                                        &nbsp;<img src="images/A.png" width="20px"> Our app doesnt come with any seperate volume control, instead, amplitude is controlled by the height at which you touch the keys. The most likely cause is therefore your ipad system volume, or perhaps you have it set to silent.<br>

                                        &nbsp;<img src="images/A.png" width="20px"> The art of scrolling in Dual Play is slightly different to in other apps, but we feel as though once you get used to it it makes playing over multiple octaves alot easier. The trick is to hold one finger within the highlighted "scroll area" at the top of the keyboard and drag the keys left or right with a second finger underneith. The upside is that you can scroll up or down octaves whilst holding onto a note during a song by simply touching down a second finger in the scroll area, and then continuing to play without any break in the music!<br>

                                        <img src="images/Q.png" width="25px"><span class="faqQs"> Why can I only change one keyboard's settings at a time?</span><br><br>
                                        &nbsp;<img src="images/A.png" width="20px"> Unfortunetly, due to the way the app is currently running, only one active popup is allowed on screen at any one time. Whilst using popups means we can offer a user more keyboard space, it does come with slight drawbacks such as the one you've mentioned. We are looking into ways we can fix this in the next few updates, so hang tight!<br>
